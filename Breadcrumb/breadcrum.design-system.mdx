Breadcrumbs consist of a list of links that help a user visualize a page's location within the hierarchical structure of a website, and allow navigation up to any of its "ancestors".

It is quite similar to the navbar or even it is kind of navbar but main diffrence is that here whatever links and content will be mention in hierarchical manner one after pervious. It allow user to interact more efficiently with webpage as it let them know where he is in page.

### SVG And Path
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic. It can be used to make graphics and animations like in HTML canvas.  Path is always used within the svg tag to set the actual coordinate.
Wihin the tag we give the some propety as what with be the co-ordinate, fill color, outer stroke, and some styling within class attribute.
