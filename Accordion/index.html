        HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. 
        Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
        Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, 
        you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
        Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. 
        Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
        Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified
         by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

  <div>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
        CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, 
        what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
        CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.

  <h3>Javascript</h3>

    <p>
        JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages,
         whose implementations allow client-side script to 
        interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
        JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being
         generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. 
         The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
