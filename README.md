<h2 align='center'>A UI kit which you always wanted‚≠ê</h2>
<p align='center'> <b> An open-source UI library built using HTML and CSS and maintained by Clueless Community</b><p>


## Important Note

This is not a repo where you can come and dump any UI code. You need to make proper components from the [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/qzwugAfEB1GL4FgWXw9R3Z/SeamLess-UI-Dev?node-id=0%3A1&t=qRahoepdI3B98cVA-1), which maintains proper design system and will be converted to a proper UI library along the way. We have just started out.
