## About SWoC 
Social Winter Of Code is the 3 month long open source program by Social India , with the aim to introduce more and more people to the world of Open source.

## Important Note

This is not a repo where you can come and dump any UI code. You need to make proper components from the [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/0eqV7t3UKKM14UeqCSfOZb/Essential-UI---Figma-Ui-Kit-(Community)?node-id=315%3A449), which maintains proper design system and will be converted to a proper UI library along the way. We have just started out.
