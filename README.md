JWoC (JGEC Winter of Code) is a begineer friendly open-source coding event organised annually by JGEC which helps students to plunge into Open Source contribution and get the realm of Software Development.


## Important Note

This is not a repo where you can come and dump any UI code. You need to make proper components from the [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/qzwugAfEB1GL4FgWXw9R3Z/SeamLess-UI-Dev?node-id=0%3A1&t=qRahoepdI3B98cVA-1), which maintains proper design system and will be converted to a proper UI library along the way. We have just started out.
