## About SWoC 
Social Winter Of Code is the 3 month long open source program by Social India , with the aim to introduce more and more people to the world of Open source. In this program all the selected participants will get a chance to work on various exciting projects under the guidance of experienced Mentors.

## Important Note

This is not a repo where you can come and dump any UI code. You need to make proper components from the [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/0eqV7t3UKKM14UeqCSfOZb/SeamLess-UI?node-id=3572%3A8556&t=rR5St9FxEhvRea9z-1), which maintains proper design system and will be converted to a proper UI library along the way. We have just started out.
