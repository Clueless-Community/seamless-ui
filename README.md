## About CodePeak 
CODE PEAK is a month-long program that helps students understand the paradigm of Open Source contribution and gives them real-world software development experience. The event targets first-timers who wish to participate in Free and Open Source(FOSS) Contributions and the experienced developers who want to show their skills by contributing to real-world projects.

## Rewards
Do you know we are sponsering CodePeak 2022 : 
1. Top 5 contributors of CodePeak will get an amazing swag kit from us. ( Which includes a t-shirt, stickers and custom printed cheatsheets and much more.)
2. Top Contributors of ClueLess projects may get an opportunity to work with ClueLess.  
3. Top 5 winners will be both featured on ClueLess official website as well as social media handles.

## Important Note

This is not a repo where you can come and dump any UI code. You need to make proper components from the [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/0eqV7t3UKKM14UeqCSfOZb/Essential-UI---Figma-Ui-Kit-(Community)?node-id=315%3A449), which maintains proper design system and will be converted to a proper UI library along the way. We have just started out. 

## How to contribute?
