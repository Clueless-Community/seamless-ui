One need to make this component using `HTML` and `Tailwind CSS`. I would suggest to use [Tailwind Playgrounds](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) to make things faster and quicker.

Here is a reference to the component. 
#### Add image here

After building the component please raise a PR with a screenshot of the component and add the component in `path of the file`. 
  
If you need to use any icon please use it from [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/)

Good luck.
